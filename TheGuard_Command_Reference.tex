\section{Master Commands}

    \subsection{\texttt{/admin}}
        \subsubsection*{Description}
            The \texttt{/admin} Command allows a Master to add someone to the List of Staff that is allowed to use the Bot. Being Admin allows someone to use Admin commands and receive reports. If the Bot has permission to add Admins, they will automatically get Telegram Admin Permission in Groups that the Bot is in which allows them to Delete Messages or view Recent Actions.\\
            Adding someone by Username will save them using their User ID since a Username can be changed so if an Admin changes his Username you don't have to make them Admin again. Before being able to make someone Admin using the Username the bot has to "know" the User so all Admins should send the Bot a Private message or a message in a Group the bot manages. The Staff is excluded from getting automatic warns.

        \subsubsection*{Syntax}
            In reply to a message: \texttt{/admin}\\
            Using a Username: \texttt{/admin @username}\\

        \subsubsection*{Description}
